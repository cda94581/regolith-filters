> Note: As of right now, *regolith* does not support the format required to apply these filters. Check out [fixed-links](#fixed-links) for the proper URLs for the time being. This will change as soon as *regolith* supports the format needed.

Within this subdirectory contains add-ons that have been premade. Simply running the filter will create the add-on properly, while running it with an exist add-on will gracefully merge the two add-ons together into one.
